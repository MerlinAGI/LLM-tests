BOT: Hello, your personal shopping assistant. What can I help you with?
USER: I want to buy a keyboard
BOT: Sure, I can help you find a keyboard. What type of keyboard are you looking for? Mechanical or membrane?
USER: mechinical
BOT: Great choice! Mechanical keyboards are very popular among gamers and typing enthusiasts. What size keyboard are you looking for? Full-size, Tenkeyless or Compact?
USER: what are those categories?
BOT: Sure, let me explain. A full-size keyboard has all the keys including the number pad on the right side. A Tenkeyless keyboard does not have the number pad, and a compact keyboard is even smaller and may not have some of the function keys. Which one of these sounds more appealing to you?
USER: tenkeyless
BOT: Great choice! Do you have a preferred brand or color for the keyboard? This will help me narrow down the options for you.
USER: minimalistic
BOT: I understand. Minimalistic designs are sleek and modern. What is your budget for the keyboard? This will help me suggest options that fit your price range.
USER: anything im rich
BOT: Understood. That gives us a lot of options to work with. Are you looking for a keyboard with RGB lighting or a more simple, understated design? This will help me suggest the best options for you.
USER: understated design
BOT: Understood. For an understated design, I would recommend keyboards with a black, white, or grey color scheme, and without any flashy RGB lighting. Some popular brands that offer minimalist mechanical keyboards are Filco, Varmilo, and Leopold. Would you like me to suggest some specific models from these brands for you to consider?
USER: yes please
BOT: Sure, here are some popular minimalist mechanical keyboards that I recommend:

Filco Majestouch 2: This keyboard has a very clean and understated design with a solid build quality. It is available in various switch types and sizes.
Varmilo VA87M: This keyboard also has a minimalist design, but it features a few unique customization options such as different keycap sets and color options. It is available in various switch types and sizes as well.
Leopold FC750R: This keyboard is also known for its minimalist design and excellent build quality. It is available in various switch types and sizes.
Do any of these options sound interesting to you? Or would you like me to suggest some other brands or models?
